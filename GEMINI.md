# Project Overview

This is a web application for viewing and filtering records. It is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material-UI. It uses TanStack Router for routing, TanStack Query for data fetching, and TanStack Table for displaying data in a table.

The application allows users to view different types of records, such as Business, Building Permit, and Zoning Variance. Users can filter the records based on various criteria and select which columns to display in the table. It also allows users to add new records.

## Key Components

- **RecordsTable.tsx**: This component is responsible for displaying the records in a table. It uses the `@tanstack/react-table` library to create the table and provides features like column visibility.
- **ColumnSelectionDrawer.tsx**: This component allows users to select which columns to display in the table. It also provides an interface for building complex filters with AND/OR conditions.
- **RecordTypeSidebar.tsx**: This component displays a list of record types and allows the user to select one. The selected record type is then used to filter the records displayed in the table.
- **Header.tsx**: This component displays the title of the application, the total number of records, the last updated time, and the number of active filters. It also includes a button to add a new record.
- **CustomButtonLink.tsx** and **CustomLink.tsx**: These are wrapper components that integrate Material-UI's `Button` and `Link` components with TanStack Router for client-side navigation.

## Routing

The application uses TanStack Router for routing. The routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory. The `routeTree.gen.ts` file is an auto-generated file that should not be edited directly.

- **_layout.index.tsx**: This is the default component that is rendered when no record type is selected. It displays a message prompting the user to select a record type.

## Theme

The application uses a custom Material-UI theme defined in `src/setup/theme.ts`. The theme sets the default font to 'Roboto Variable'.

## API Endpoints

The application interacts with a backend API to fetch and create records. The base URL for the API is configured in the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.

- `GET /records`: Fetches a paginated list of records. It accepts the following query parameters:
    - `page`: The page number to fetch.
    - `limit`: The number of records per page.
    - `type`: The type of records to fetch.
    - `filters`: A JSON string representing the filters to apply.
    - `columns`: A comma-separated list of columns to fetch.
- `POST /records`: Creates a new record.
- `GET /records/autocomplete`: Fetches autocomplete suggestions for a given field.

## Mock Data

The project includes a mock data file at `src/data/recordsData.json`. This file is used for development purposes and contains a sample of records.

## Public Assets

The `public` directory contains static assets that are served directly. This includes the `favicon.ico` file.

# Building and Running

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or a compatible package manager)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

# Development Conventions

## Code Style

The project uses Prettier for code formatting. It is recommended to set up your editor to format on save.

## Version Control

The project uses Git for version control. The `.git` directory contains the git repository. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude common files and directories, such as `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.env` files.

## Dependencies

The project's dependencies are managed in the `package.json` file. The `package-lock.json` file is a snapshot of the exact dependency tree, and it is recommended to commit this file to version control. The `node_modules` directory contains the installed dependencies.

## Temporary Files

The `.tanstack/tmp` and `.temp` directories contain temporary files generated by the development server and other tools. These directories are included in the `.gitignore` file and should not be committed to version control.
